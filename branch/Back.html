                        <h1>Backpack</h1>
                        <p>The <b>Backpack</b> is the main tool that the player has throughout Astroneer. It features a total of ten small attachment slots, with an additional three slots on the Terrain Tool, a printer, a handle to access the research catalog, a handle to access the mission log, a built-in oxygen canister, and a built-in battery for powering the printer or the Terrain Tool.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Inventory Slots</h2></span>
                        <p>The backpack has 8 slots dedicated to resource and small item storage. Items can be placed into, removed from, and rearranged within these slots manually, but as long as there is an inventory slot available, resource nuggets collected with the deform tool or items created using the backpack's printer will be automatically placed there. If all inventory slots are full, newly created or collected items will drop to the ground nearby.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Widget Slots</h2></span>
                        <p>There are 2 additional slots on the top left and right of the backpack, which is meant for Widgets. These are commonly used to host items such as the Solar Panel, Worklight or Portable Oxygenator. Some widgets in these slots can be toggled on and off using the context keys such as the Worklight, Portable Oxygenator or Small Generator. Like other attachment points, however, they can also be fitted with resource stacks or other small items for additional storage.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Research Catalog</h2></span>
                        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/astroneer_gamepedia/images/5/59/Catalog.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190216204225" alt="" style="float: right; padding-top: 15px;" width="180px">
                        <p>Pressing Tab or clicking the handle on the left side of the backpack will open the research catalog, where player can purchase Schematics using accumulated Bytes. The catalog is separated into 4 different size categories, corresponding to the four sizes of objects created by the corresponding printers. The context keys can be used to move around those categories.</p>
                        <p>The catalog includes a pad with buttons that can be used to navigate around it, which also hints which controller buttons are used to navigate around the catalog.</p>
                        <p>The movement keys can be used to move around a category, and the Context Left/Right keys to change categories. Alternatively, the buttons and schematics can be clicked on to move to categories or different items.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Mission Log</h2></span>
                        <p>Clicking the handle on the right of the backpack brings up the Mission Log. This allows to check missions, track them, and claim Byte Rewards for completed missions.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Backpack Printer</h2></span>
                        <p>Using the small printer on the Backpack, items can be crafted on the go at the cost of 3 Units of Power. Cycling through the available items will automatically move the appropriate resource to the printer's input slot if it is already in the backpack. This input slot can be used to deliberately store a specific extra resource, if so desired, but be forewarned that changing the item to be printed will eject the contents of the input slot from the backpack if the rest of its inventory slots are already full.</p>
                        <p>Larger objects can be printed using the Small Printer, Medium Printer, and Large Printer.</p>
                        <span class="head"><h2>Oxygen and Power Storage</h2></span>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>Prominently displayed on the backpack are two gauges: the horizontal oxygen gauge in light blue, and the vertical power gauge in bright yellow.</li>
                            <li>Enough oxygen is stored for 72.5 seconds of untethered field work. Running consumes a little more oxygen, making the tank empty in 50 seconds instead.</li>
                            <li>You get a notification when the tank is 50% and then 25% full. When you run out of oxygen, you are suffocating. Within 5 seconds of starting to suffocate, you cannot run anymore. After 15 seconds of suffocation, you will die and be sent back to your ship or shelter.</li>
                            <li>The backpack's oxygen reserve can be augmented with Oxygen Tanks, which store an amount of oxygen equal to the backpack's own tank, and by crafting Oxygen Filters, which provide oxygen as though connected to a Tether and last 80 seconds before burning out. Additionally, the Portable Oxygenatorprovides infinite oxygen at the cost of power, and supplies other nearby Astroneers as well.</li>
                            <li>Each segment of the vertical yellow bar represents a single Unit of power, storing a total of 10 Units.</li>
                            <li>Power is only drained when using an Augment on the Terrain Tool, or when using the printer.</li>
                            <li>A small battery stores enough power to use a single augmented deform tool continuously for about 64 seconds, depending on whether power-generating widgets are being used.</li>
                            <li>As an internal battery, the backpack will not transfer its charge to other batteries.</li>
                            <li>The backpack's battery can be augmented with Small Batteries, which store just over triple the base capacity, and by crafting Power Cells, which provide just under five times the base capacity before burning out. Additionally, generator widgets provide a continuous supply of power when their conditions are met.</li>
                        </ul>
